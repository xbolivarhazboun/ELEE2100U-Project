# ELEE2100U-Project

A few files that were used in our supercapacitor bike project.

The file parsing was done in Java.

The overall objective to this program was to find the optimal capacitor in terms of energy capacity/volume. A list of data was taken from DigiKey and parsed.

I personally did the Circuit Analysis for this project so I can tell you that the supercapacitor bike's charging system is unlikely to behave in a predictable way. The LaTeX files and the final report will be uploaded at a future date.
